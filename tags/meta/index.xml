      <description>&lt;p&gt;Winner of best technical achievement at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vrhackathon.web3d.org/seattle-2017-09/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2017 Seattle VR Hackathon&lt;/a&gt;. VR is a medium thatâ€™s quickly becoming a new creative outlet. We believe it is a way of making music based on natural movements, without relying on existing instrument interfaces. The level of immersion can unlock latent musical abilities in new users, or extend the abilities of existing musicians.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Edifecs rebrand in 2013, most internal and external systems received updates. Part 1 of this endeavor was to enhance many internal systems, such as the company&amp;rsquo;s SharePoint Intranet. The company felt that with the fact the company was rapidly growing, overall enhancements internally were needed to help employees and solidify the brand.&lt;/p&gt;
