      <description>&lt;p&gt;Main corporate website redesign and rebuild was being worked in on in parallel with internal branding changes. The premise was similar to the internal updates.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Edifecs rebrand in 2013, most internal and external systems received updates. Part 1 of this endeavor was to enhance many internal systems, such as the company&amp;rsquo;s SharePoint Intranet. The company felt that with the fact the company was rapidly growing, overall enhancements internally were needed to help employees and solidify the brand.&lt;/p&gt;
