			As a Partner and Lead Product Manager at <a href="https://actuateventures.co" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Actuate Ventures</a>, I bridge investment strategy with hands-on product leadership across our portfolio companies. With my background as a startup founder, I understand the unique pressures and rapid decision cycles that define early-stage ventures, where survival can be measured in hours instead of quarters. My approach balances strategic vision with operational execution, ensuring portfolio companies deliver high-impact products, meet critical milestones, and maximize investor confidence.

		<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

		<p>
			Startups within Actuate's portfolio face extreme constraints: limited resources, aggressive timelines, and existential risk. Unlike established firms, these teams must iterate and ship rapidly, sometimes pivoting within days or hours to avoid failure. Actuate's value-add is not just capital, but hands-on leadership to accelerate product delivery, optimize team performance, and create investor-ready narratives.
		</p>

		<h3 id="solutions">Solution</h3>

		<p>
			As Product Management Lead, I directed teams of designers and developers for multiple portfolio companies, setting product vision, roadmaps, and execution plans. As an Investment Partner, I sourced and led investments, applying product and technical diligence to identify and nurture high-potential startups. Drawing on my founder experience, I empathized with and guided teams through high-stakes pivots, crisis management, and market launches. I managed cross-functional teams to deliver apps, decks, and shippable code, ensuring products reached customers and investors on time.
		</p>

		<h3 id="case-study">Case Study: Drone Inspection Platform for Aircraft and Spacecraft</h3>

		<p>
			One standout portfolio company developed a drone-based inspection solution for aircraft and spacecraft, dramatically reducing turnaround times for safety checks and maintenance. By automating inspections, airlines and space operators could return vehicles to service faster, improving operational efficiency and safety.
