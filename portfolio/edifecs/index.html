Made the site responsive, performant, and more usable. Traffic and other success metrics have all improved. The redesign focused on modern development practices, modular design, and better user journeys for researchers, decision makers, and customers.</p><div class=highlight-cards><div class=highlight-card><div class=highlight-icon>📱</div><h3>Responsive Design</h3><p>Transformed a 2010-era desktop-only site into a fully responsive platform that works seamlessly across all devices.</p></div><div class=highlight-card><div class=highlight-icon>⚡</div><h3>Performance Optimization</h3><p>Implemented best practices to achieve consistent 60fps rendering and fast page loads, improving user experience significantly.</p></div><div class=highlight-card><div class=highlight-icon>📊</div><h3>Traffic Growth</h3><p>Increased site traffic while reducing bounce rates, generating more leads and training sales through improved user journeys.</p></div><div class=highlight-card><div class=highlight-icon>🎯</div><h3>Modular Architecture</h3><p>Created reusable content modules and standardized page layouts, enabling faster content creation and consistent experiences.</p></div></div></div><figure class=hero-image><img src=/images/esite-solution-thumb.jpg alt="Redesigned solution page" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Redesigned solution page with improved layout and content structure</figcaption></figure><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/esite-solution-original-thumb.jpg alt="Original 2010 solution page" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Original 2010 solution page before redesign</figcaption></figure><section class=portfolio-section><h2 id=problem>Problem</h2><p>The site (1.0) was built in 2010 and did not receive any major updates until the rebuild. During that time, responsive design was not yet common for B2B enterprise companies. The design lacked focus, often copying common design patterns from competitors. As the company's headcount ballooned year after year, ensuring the corporate website attracted good talent became critical.</p><p><strong>Key Issues:</strong></p><ul><li>Not responsive - desktop-only design</li><li>Design cluttered and unfocused</li><li>Messaging stale and outdated</li><li>Many technical issues and performance problems</li><li>SEO and SEM problems affecting discoverability</li></ul><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/esite-notes.jpg alt="Project notes and planning" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Project planning and research notes</figcaption></figure></section><section class=portfolio-section><h2 id=solutions>Solution</h2><p>Built a new modern site (2.0) with a committed focus on web as a platform to better market, educate, and engage customers. This was not a simple reskin or slight enhancement, but a complete overhaul. Site 2.0 had all content, graphics, and code redone from scratch. A large multi-department project formed to complete this 1+ year initiative.</p><p>An important change in mindset was adopted: core pages were no longer independent of each other. The user's journey on a website is just as much a part of the sales journey as anything else. Content was written in sections with the concept that it would be plugged into other pages as needed.</p><section class=impact-stats aria-labelledby=impact-heading><h3 id=impact-heading>Impact</h3><div class=impact-accent aria-hidden=true></div><dl class=stats-grid><div class=stat-item><dt class=stat-value>100%</dt><dd class=stat-label>Responsive</dd></div><div class=stat-item><dt class=stat-value>60fps</dt><dd class=stat-label>Performance Target</dd></div><div class=stat-item><dt class=stat-value>↓</dt><dd class=stat-label>Reduced Bounce Rate</dd></div><div class=stat-item><dt class=stat-value>↑</dt><dd class=stat-label>Increased Traffic</dd></div></dl></section><div class=solution-details><div class=detail-section><h3>Technology</h3><p>We selected technologies that enabled modern development practices and marketing automation:</p><div class=tech-badges><span class=tech-badge>ExpressionEngine</span>
<span class=tech-badge>Bootstrap</span>
<span class=tech-badge>LAMP</span>
<span class=tech-badge>Marketo</span>
<span class=tech-badge>WordPress</span>
<span class=tech-badge>SVG</span>
<span class=tech-badge>JavaScript</span></div></div><div class=detail-section><h3>Target Users</h3><p>The redesign focused on three key personas:</p><ul><li><strong>Researcher:</strong> Often the first contact in the sales chain, spends time reading about solutions, passes information to decision makers</li><li><strong>Directors+:</strong> Decision makers involved near the end of sales cycles, spend time reading through additional offerings</li><li><strong>Customer:</strong> Already using the solution, looks for documentation and trainings on solutions they're using</li></ul></div></div></section><section class=portfolio-section><h2 id=design>Design</h2><p>Two primary design goals were achieved: tell a better, more cohesive story on the homepage, and simplify design templates to more easily produce new pages as needed.</p><h3>Homepage</h3><p>Company homepages are often the first page a new or returning user lands on. 2.0's homepage uses a concept of <strong>100% sections</strong>. It's often difficult to deliver a direct message when a large B2B company offers many solutions. By using the 100% method, only one direct message is used per section. Scrolling slides the user into the next or previous section. Content and messaging don't have to fight one another.</p><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/esite-homepage-original-thumb.jpg alt="Original 2011 homepage" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Original 2011 homepage</figcaption></figure><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/esite-homepage-final-thumb.jpg alt="Redesigned homepage" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Redesigned homepage with 100% section approach</figcaption></figure><h3>Solution and Resources</h3><p>The product solution pages are key pages on edifecs.com because of the information they deliver. For companies like Edifecs, where sales cycles happen over many months or even years, users often come back to these solution pages for information. Selling products is not as good a strategy as selling solutions, and the pages were designed with that in mind.</p><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/esite-whiteboard.jpg alt="Whiteboarding page layouts" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Whiteboarding and layout planning</figcaption></figure><p>By better standardizing page layouts, product owners and stakeholders could more easily produce consistent content. Many rules were set up to keep content limited but meaningful: word count ranges, stricter body copy guidelines, and graphics and diagram standards.</p><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/esite-resources.jpg alt="Resource design system" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Resource design system with color-coded labeling</figcaption></figure><h3>Trainings</h3><p>A large new offering within 2.0 is a stronger education section. Solutions like Edifecs' require a level of mastery achieved through training and practice. Enterprise software purchasers know this, and when vetting solutions look to the complete support cycle offered. An entire microsite was designed to allow users to get the training they needed.</p><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/esite-courses.jpg alt="Training courses interface" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Training and certificate program interface</figcaption></figure></section><section class=portfolio-section><h2 id=development>Development</h2><p>Both the front and backend were overhauled during development. Because all content was being rewritten, very little needed to be ported over to the 2.0 site. Overall there was a development focus on speed, performance, and ease of use. Reducing overhead and shortening the time to commit new code and content were crucial moving forward.</p><p><strong>Frontend:</strong> Responsive design became part of standard practice. Development set limitations on designs to not use performance-heavy modules too often on a single page, using many best practices to attempt consistent 60fps and overall fast rendering.</p><p><strong>Backend:</strong> In 1.0, page entries contained content. 2.0 changed this so page entries only reference content modules. By separating all content into separate entry types, overall control and reusability was easily achieved. This structure allowed for greater permission management, as content creators could work more safely on content chunks rather than whole pages.</p><p><strong>Integrations:</strong> Marketing automation solutions like Marketo were heavily used. The front and backend had these integrations in mind when being written, ensuring the company's business needs were supported without degrading user experience for site visitors.</p><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/esite-timelines.jpg alt="Project timelines" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Content sprints and project timelines</figcaption></figure></section><section class=portfolio-section><h2 id=success>Successes</h2><p>Since launch, the 2.0 site has continued to evolve and grow:</p><ul><li>Traffic has increased while bounce rates have dropped</li><li>Leads have been generated through improved user journeys</li><li>Trainings have been sold through the new education platform</li><li>The blog was awarded best healthcare IT blog after the first year</li><li>Content creation became faster and more consistent with modular architecture</li></ul></section><section class=portfolio-section><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Completing design and development of the corporate website did not mean it was finished. With the new processes created, the web property continues to receive updates and new developments that provide more to the users' experience almost every day. The modular architecture and modern development practices ensure the site can evolve without requiring major overhauls for years to come.</p></section></div></article></main><footer role=contentinfo><p>© Chris Le Nguyen.
