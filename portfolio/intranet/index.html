SharePoint intranet and internal communication redesign project. Rebuilt to better employee communication and strengthen the company brand. As part of the Edifecs rebrand in 2013, most internal and external systems received updates. This project enhanced many internal systems, including the company's SharePoint Intranet, to support rapid company growth from 200 to 500+ employees worldwide.

<h2 id=problem>Problem</h2>
<p>
The company was entering its 16th year, experiencing rapid growth. The market was changing rapidly due to national healthcare changes, and with many successes, a lot of new employees were being hired—growing from some 200 to more than 500 worldwide by 2016. Many internal systems were not designed or provided well for the new volume of employees and projects. An overhaul of Edifecs' intranet and communications was needed to support this growth and maintain company culture.
</p>
</section>
<section class=portfolio-section>
<h2 id=solutions>Solution</h2>
<p>
The internal solutions project was split into two areas: restructuring and designing the SharePoint, and standardizing internal communications and branding. This included providing a means to segment different locations so that each office would not feel left out from headquarters. Doing so would alleviate stress and issues new employees and teams would face, allowing more overall productivity.

<figcaption>Employee survey results informing design decisions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Several surveys were conducted within the company, asking employees Likert scale questions on different aspects of the company's SharePoint. Focus groups were conducted as well, with group rating exercises and card sorting exercises. Key findings:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools - 20 points</li>
<li>UI - 20 points</li>
<li>Social - 16 points</li>
<li>Company Info - 9 points</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=sharepoint>SharePoint Redesign</h2>
<p>
Over the course of several quarters, the main landing page was redesigned and rebuilt. The focus for the homepage was derived after surveys and focus groups were performed. The content focused on three parts: latest news, utility items, and calendar events.
</p>
<h3>Key Homepage Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Company announcement news banner</li>
<li>A company news feed</li>
<li>Event Calendars</li>
<li>Quick links</li>
<li>Office specific links</li>
</ul>

<h3>Department Pages</h3>
<p>
After rolling out the new homepage, each department site collection received redesigns for top level pages. Keeping each site collection at a high level consistent would allow any user to more easily navigate around. Before the redesign, each department site collection had its own design, layout, and information architecture.

<h2 id=communication>Internal Communication</h2>
<p>
To tie the internal redesign efforts together, standardized communication systems were created to ensure consistent branding and information delivery.
</p>
<h3>Email Templates</h3>
<p>
Company-wide emails are sent on a regular basis: event announcements, customer wins, internal classes, etc. For a long time in the company's history, no standard email template was enforced. The lack of cohesion meant the information being delivered to employees was very inconsistent. By creating unified email templates for internal use, the company could accomplish important goals: spread the new brand, provide consistent and digestible information to employees, and allow each department to have micro-branding to help set each other apart.
</p>

</figure>
<h3>Blogs</h3>
<p>
Each department got its own dedicated blog. The blogging system is tied directly to the email templates, so departments can create both items at once. Blog entries are saved to a SharePoint list, and that list is surfaced on the newly designed homepage. This doubles as an email archiving system as well.
</p>
</section>
<section class=portfolio-section>
<h2 id=success>Successes</h2>
<p>
The redesign efforts produced measurable improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved employee navigation and reduced time spent on administrative tasks</li>
<li>Better communication across all office locations</li>
<li>Consistent branding and messaging through standardized templates</li>
<li>Increased employee engagement with company news and events</li>
<li>Streamlined content creation process for departments</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class=portfolio-section>
<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The SharePoint intranet and internal communication redesign successfully supported Edifecs' rapid growth from 200 to 500+ employees. By restructuring information architecture, standardizing communications, and creating tools that segment content by location, the company maintained its culture and improved productivity. The new systems continue to evolve, supporting the company's ongoing growth and changing needs.
