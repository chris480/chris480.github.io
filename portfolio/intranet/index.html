Rebuilt to better employee communication and strengthen the company brand. As part of the Edifecs rebrand in 2013, most internal and external systems received updates. This project enhanced many internal systems, including the company's SharePoint Intranet, to support rapid company growth from 200 to 500+ employees worldwide.</p><div class=highlight-cards><div class=highlight-card><div class=highlight-icon>🏢</div><h3>Intranet Redesign</h3><p>Redesigned and restructured the SharePoint intranet to better serve a growing workforce, improving navigation and information architecture.</p></div><div class=highlight-card><div class=highlight-icon>📧</div><h3>Email Templates</h3><p>Created unified email templates for internal communications, ensuring consistent branding and digestible information delivery.</p></div><div class=highlight-card><div class=highlight-icon>👥</div><h3>Employee Engagement</h3><p>Improved internal communication and reduced administrative overhead, allowing employees to focus on productivity rather than navigation.</p></div><div class=highlight-card><div class=highlight-icon>🌐</div><h3>Multi-Location Support</h3><p>Designed systems to segment different office locations, ensuring each office felt connected to headquarters and company culture.</p></div></div></div><figure class=hero-image><img src=/images/sharepoint-final-thumb.jpg alt="Redesigned SharePoint intranet homepage" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Redesigned SharePoint intranet homepage</figcaption></figure><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/sharepoint-before-2013-thumb.jpg alt="Original SharePoint intranet" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Original SharePoint intranet before redesign</figcaption></figure><section class=portfolio-section><h2 id=problem>Problem</h2><p>The company was entering its 16th year, experiencing rapid growth. The market was changing rapidly due to national healthcare changes, and with many successes, a lot of new employees were being hired—growing from some 200 to more than 500 worldwide by 2016. Many internal systems were not designed or provided well for the new volume of employees and projects. An overhaul of Edifecs' intranet and communications was needed to support this growth and maintain company culture.</p></section><section class=portfolio-section><h2 id=solutions>Solution</h2><p>The internal solutions project was split into two areas: restructuring and designing the SharePoint, and standardizing internal communications and branding. This included providing a means to segment different locations so that each office would not feel left out from headquarters. Doing so would alleviate stress and issues new employees and teams would face, allowing more overall productivity.</p><section class=impact-stats aria-labelledby=impact-heading><h3 id=impact-heading>Impact</h3><div class=impact-accent aria-hidden=true></div><dl class=stats-grid><div class=stat-item><dt class=stat-value>500+</dt><dd class=stat-label>Employees Supported</dd></div><div class=stat-item><dt class=stat-value>3</dt><dd class=stat-label>Key Focus Areas</dd></div><div class=stat-item><dt class=stat-value>↓</dt><dd class=stat-label>Reduced Admin Time</dd></div><div class=stat-item><dt class=stat-value>↑</dt><dd class=stat-label>Employee Engagement</dd></div></dl></section><div class=solution-details><div class=detail-section><h3>Deliverables</h3><p>The project delivered comprehensive improvements across internal systems:</p><ul><li>Redesigned Intranet homepage and department pages</li><li>Restructured information architecture for better navigation</li><li>Email communication templates for consistent branding</li><li>Department blogs tied to email system</li><li>Office-specific content segmentation</li></ul></div><div class=detail-section><h3>Research and Design</h3><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/sharepoint-survey.jpg alt="Employee survey results" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Employee survey results informing design decisions</figcaption></figure><p>Several surveys were conducted within the company, asking employees Likert scale questions on different aspects of the company's SharePoint. Focus groups were conducted as well, with group rating exercises and card sorting exercises. Key findings:</p><ul><li>Tools - 20 points</li><li>UI - 20 points</li><li>Social - 16 points</li><li>Company Info - 9 points</li></ul></div></div></section><section class=portfolio-section><h2 id=sharepoint>SharePoint Redesign</h2><p>Over the course of several quarters, the main landing page was redesigned and rebuilt. The focus for the homepage was derived after surveys and focus groups were performed. The content focused on three parts: latest news, utility items, and calendar events.</p><h3>Key Homepage Features</h3><ul><li>Company announcement news banner</li><li>A company news feed</li><li>Event Calendars</li><li>Quick links</li><li>Office specific links</li></ul><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/sharepoint-final-thumb.jpg alt="Intranet mockup" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Wireframe mockup by Samuel Shen</figcaption></figure><h3>Department Pages</h3><p>After rolling out the new homepage, each department site collection received redesigns for top level pages. Keeping each site collection at a high level consistent would allow any user to more easily navigate around. Before the redesign, each department site collection had its own design, layout, and information architecture.</p><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/sharepoint-sktech-thumb.jpg alt="Department site sketch" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Initial sketch for department site template</figcaption></figure><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/sharepoint-whiteboard-thumb.jpg alt="Whiteboard design session" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Whiteboard design session</figcaption></figure><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/sharepoint-department-thumb.jpg alt="Final department template" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Final department site template</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Key Features:</strong> News Banner, Tiles of major links to subpages, Sidebar of links to resources</p></section><section class=portfolio-section><h2 id=communication>Internal Communication</h2><p>To tie the internal redesign efforts together, standardized communication systems were created to ensure consistent branding and information delivery.</p><h3>Email Templates</h3><p>Company-wide emails are sent on a regular basis: event announcements, customer wins, internal classes, etc. For a long time in the company's history, no standard email template was enforced. The lack of cohesion meant the information being delivered to employees was very inconsistent. By creating unified email templates for internal use, the company could accomplish important goals: spread the new brand, provide consistent and digestible information to employees, and allow each department to have micro-branding to help set each other apart.</p><figure class=portfolio-image><img src=/images/email-thumb.jpg alt="Sample email template" loading=lazy decoding=async><figcaption>Sample email template—dozens created in total</figcaption></figure><h3>Blogs</h3><p>Each department got its own dedicated blog. The blogging system is tied directly to the email templates, so departments can create both items at once. Blog entries are saved to a SharePoint list, and that list is surfaced on the newly designed homepage. This doubles as an email archiving system as well.</p></section><section class=portfolio-section><h2 id=success>Successes</h2><p>The redesign efforts produced measurable improvements:</p><ul><li>Improved employee navigation and reduced time spent on administrative tasks</li><li>Better communication across all office locations</li><li>Consistent branding and messaging through standardized templates</li><li>Increased employee engagement with company news and events</li><li>Streamlined content creation process for departments</li></ul></section><section class=portfolio-section><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>The SharePoint intranet and internal communication redesign successfully supported Edifecs' rapid growth from 200 to 500+ employees. By restructuring information architecture, standardizing communications, and creating tools that segment content by location, the company maintained its culture and improved productivity. The new systems continue to evolve, supporting the company's ongoing growth and changing needs.</p></section></div></article></main><footer role=contentinfo><p>© Chris Le Nguyen.
