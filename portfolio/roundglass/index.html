			<p>RoundGlass Wellbeing Social Platform & Design System</p>
			<p>
				As Principal UX & Engineering Lead, I led and mentored a team of over 10 front-end engineers to design and architect a custom social media platform for wellbeing. This hybrid role allowed me to drive improvements in Accessibility, SEO, Quality, UX, speed, and team independence. The Angular-based platform achieved up to 80% performance gains in critical flows, while a robust design system powered multiple consumer apps, an email communication system, and a refined site builder for rapid deployment and brand consistency.

			<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
			<p>
				RoundGlass sought to create a scalable, high-performance social platform to foster wellbeing and community engagement. The challenge was to architect a flexible, user-friendly solution that could underpin public-facing apps, internal tools, and new site launches, while bridging the gap between UX and engineering and ensuring best-in-class Accessibility, SEO, and Quality.
			</p>

			<h3 id="solutions">Solution</h3>
			<p>
				I defined the architectural direction for the Angular platform, aligning technical and UX goals with business objectives. Leading and mentoring a team of over 10 front-end engineers, I championed improvements in Accessibility, SEO, Quality, UX, speed, and independence. My approach included:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Architecting a modular, scalable Angular front-end for rapid iteration and maintainability.</li>
				<li>Implementing advanced performance optimizations, resulting in up to 80% speed improvements in onboarding, content feeds, and messaging.</li>
				<li>Developing a comprehensive design system powering the social platform, consumer apps, and email tools.</li>
				<li>Creating a refined site builder for rapid, independent deployment of new branded sites.</li>
				<li>Instituting regular design-engineering syncs, office hours, and shared documentation to foster collaboration and trust.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Acting as a liaison between UX and engineering was a privilege and key to breaking down silos and unlocking innovation across the organization.
			</p>

			<h3 id="success">Successes</h3>
			<p>
				Our efforts produced measurable impact across the organization:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Platform speed improved by up to 80% in critical use cases.</li>
				<li>Accessibility and SEO met and exceeded industry standards.</li>
				<li>Delivery times drastically reduced through improved cross-team collaboration.</li>
				<li>Design system adoption powered multiple consumer apps and email systems.</li>
				<li>New sites launched in days, not weeks, using the site builder.</li>
				<li>Unified brand experience and increased team independence, teams launched projects with minimal engineering support.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="leadership">Leadership & Learnings</h3>
			<p>
				I mentored and empowered over 10 front-end engineers, fostering a culture of independence and continuous improvement. Presenting outcomes and best practices at internal summits influenced design system adoption across other RoundGlass initiatives. Leading a large engineering team and acting as a liaison between UX and engineering was key to breaking down silos and unlocking innovation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Balancing ambitious performance and accessibility goals with the need for platform flexibility was a core challenge. Modularizing the architecture and prioritizing optimizations in user-critical paths, while mentoring the engineering team in best practices, ensured success.
			</p>

			<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
			<p>
				By leading and mentoring a large engineering team and driving improvements in Accessibility, SEO, Quality, UX, speed, and independence, I enabled RoundGlass to deliver a high-performance, scalable, and cohesive digital ecosystem. This work exemplifies my approach as a principal UX and engineering leader, bridging disciplines, driving measurable impact, and empowering teams to create meaningful user experiences.
