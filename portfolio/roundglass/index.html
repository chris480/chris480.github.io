<p class=hero-description>
As Principal UX & Engineering Lead, I led and mentored a team of over 10 front-end engineers to design and architect a custom social media platform for wellbeing. This hybrid role allowed me to drive improvements in Accessibility, SEO, Quality, UX, speed, and team independence. The Angular-based platform achieved up to 80% performance gains in critical flows, while a robust design system powered multiple consumer apps, an email communication system, and a refined site builder for rapid deployment and brand consistency.
